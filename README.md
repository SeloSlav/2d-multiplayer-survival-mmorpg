## ‚ö° Quick Local Setup

For experienced users familiar with Node.js, Rust, and SpacetimeDB. See detailed sections below for troubleshooting or authentication specifics.

**0. Install SpacetimeDB CLI:**
Follow the instructions for your OS: [https://spacetimedb.com/install](https://spacetimedb.com/install)
(e.g., `curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh` on macOS/Linux)

**1. Clone & Install Dependencies:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeloSlav/vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival.git
cd vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival
npm install
```

**2. Generate Auth Keys:**
```bash
# Ensure OpenSSL is installed (https://www.openssl.org/source/)
mkdir keys
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem
```

**3. Start All Services (3 Terminals):**

**Terminal 1 - Auth Server:**
```bash
cd auth-server-openauth/
npm install
npm run dev
# Auth Server running on http://localhost:4001
```

**Terminal 2 - SpacetimeDB Server:**
```bash
cd server/
spacetime start
# SpacetimeDB Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**Terminal 3 - Client:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Client running on http://localhost:3008 (or similar)
```

**4. Deploy Database (First Time Setup):**
```bash
# In server/ directory - choose one:
./deploy-local-clean.ps1     # Windows - Fresh database
./deploy-local.ps1           # Windows - Update existing database
# Or manually:
spacetime publish broth-bullets-local
spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .
```

*   **For Multiplayer Testing:** Open a **new terminal** and run `npm run dev` again. The second client will open on a different port. Open this URL in a separate browser tab.

## üîê Authentication Setup

This project implements user authentication using a custom Node.js authentication server built with OpenAuthJS and Hono, bridged to SpacetimeDB via standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWTs.

**Approach:**

1.  **Client:** Initiates an OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, manually constructing the `/authorize` URL for the custom auth server and specifying `acr_values=pwd` to request the password flow.
2.  **Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):** A Node.js/Hono server that:
    *   Intercepts the `/authorize` request.
    *   If `acr_values=pwd`, redirects the user to custom HTML login/registration forms, forwarding OIDC parameters (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, `code_challenge`, etc.).
    *   Handles POST submissions from these forms, verifying user credentials against a local user store (`data/users.json`).
    *   On successful login/registration, generates a one-time authorization `code` and stores it along with the user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Redirects the user back to the client's specified `redirect_uri` with the `code` and `state`.
3.  **Client:** Receives the redirect at its `/callback` URI, extracts the `code`.
4.  **Client:** Makes a `fetch` POST request to the auth server's custom `/token` endpoint, sending the `code`, PKCE `code_verifier`, `client_id`, and `redirect_uri`.
5.  **Auth Server (`/token`):**
    *   Receives the code exchange request.
    *   Looks up the code, retrieves the associated user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Verifies the `code_verifier` against the stored `code_challenge`.
    *   If valid, mints a new JWT `id_token` and `access_token`, signed using a **private RSA key** (RS256 algorithm).
    *   Returns the tokens to the client.
6.  **Client:** Receives the tokens, stores the `id_token` (used as the `spacetimeToken`).
7.  **Client:** Connects to the main SpacetimeDB game server (`server/`) using the `id_token`.
8.  **SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Configured with the `issuer` URL of the auth server.
    *   Fetches the OIDC discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) and then the public keys (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) from the auth server.
    *   Verifies the `id_token`'s signature using the fetched public key and validates the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims.
    *   Grants the connection access based on the identity (`sub` claim) in the validated token.

This approach uses standard OIDC practices with asymmetric key signing (RS256), allowing SpacetimeDB to securely verify tokens without needing a shared secret.

### Running Authentication Locally

To get authentication working during local development, follow these steps:

1.  **Generate RSA Keys:** You need an RSA key pair for signing and verifying tokens. Use OpenSSL:
    *   Open a terminal in the **project root** directory.
    *   Run the following commands:
        ```bash
        # Create a directory for keys if it doesn't exist
        mkdir keys
        # Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
        # Extract the public key from the private key
        openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem
        ```
    *   This creates `keys/private.pem` (keep secret, used by auth server) and `keys/public.pem` (used for verification).
    *   **Important:** The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent these keys from being committed to Git.

2.  **Configure Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):**
    *   No `.env` file is strictly required for basic local operation, as defaults are set in `index.ts`.
    *   The server automatically loads `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` for signing tokens and serving the JWKS endpoint.
    *   It manages user data in `data/users.json` (which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist). The `.gitignore` also prevents this file from being committed.

3.  **Run Auth Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `auth-server-openauth/` directory.
    *   Run `npm install` if you haven't already.
    *   Run `npm start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running. You should see `üöÄ Auth server ‚Üí http://localhost:4001`. Logs for authentication steps will appear here.

4.  **Configure SpacetimeDB Server (`server/data/config.toml`):**
    *   Ensure the `server/data/config.toml` file has the following `[auth]` configuration to trust your auth server:
        ```toml
        [auth]
        [[identity_provider]]
        type     = "oidc"
        issuer   = "http://localhost:4001"       # URL of our OpenAuth server
        jwks_uri = "http://localhost:4001/.well-known/jwks.json" # Explicitly point to the JWKS endpoint
        audience = "vibe-survival-game-client" # Must match 'aud' claim in tokens
        ```

5.  **Run Main SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Open a **separate terminal**.
    *   Run `spacetime start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running.

6.  **Client Configuration:** No changes are needed in the client code. `AuthContext.tsx` is configured to use the auth server at `http://localhost:4001`.

7.  **Run Client:**
    *   Open a terminal in the project **root** directory.
    *   Run `npm run dev`.

Now, when you sign in via the client's login screen, the full authentication flow using your custom OpenAuthJS server and RS256 keys should execute.

### Production Deployment

*   **Auth Server:** Deploy the `auth-server-openauth` Node.js application to a hosting provider. Ensure the `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` files are securely deployed alongside the application (or manage keys via environment variables/secrets management if your host supports it). Ensure it's served over HTTPS.
*   **Client:** Update `AUTH_SERVER_URL` in `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to point to your *deployed* auth server URL (using HTTPS).
*   **SpacetimeDB:** Configure your SpacetimeDB Maincloud/Enterprise instance with the *production* `issuer` and `jwks_uri` of your deployed auth server, and the correct `audience`.

### Limitations & Future Improvements

*   **Basic Forms:** The login/register forms served by the auth server are very basic HTML. They could be enhanced or replaced with a proper frontend framework if desired.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling in the manual auth routes could be more user-friendly.
*   **No Refresh Token Handling:** This setup doesn't implement refresh tokens. If the `id_token` expires, the user would need to log in again.

## üìú Cursor Rules & Code Maintainability

### Cursor Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

This project utilizes [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)'s AI features, including **Rules**, to aid development. Rules are markdown files (`.mdc`) that provide context and guidelines to the AI assistant.
*   `guide.mdc`: Contains general architectural guidelines, technology choices, and development workflow information.
*   `resources.mdc`: Outlines the specific steps for adding new resources or gatherable nodes consistently.

As the project grows, more specific rules will be added for core features (e.g., crafting, building, combat) to ensure the AI can provide consistent and relevant assistance.

### Code Maintainability

While the project is still evolving, a key goal is maintainability. As features are added, we aim to:
*   Keep individual file sizes manageable (ideally under ~600 lines where practical).
*   Refactor logic into reusable helper functions and potentially dedicated modules (like the planned `inventory_logic.rs`).
*   Utilize abstraction to avoid code duplication, especially for common interactions like container management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Client Configuration

### SpacetimeDB Connection (`client/src/App.tsx`)

To connect the client to your SpacetimeDB instance, configure the following constants near the top of `client/src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS = 'ws://localhost:3000';
const SPACETIME_DB_NAME = 'vibe-survival-game';
```

*   **For Local Development:** Use the default values (`ws://localhost:3000` and your module name).
*   **For Maincloud Deployment:** Replace `SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS` with your Maincloud WebSocket URI (e.g., `wss://maincloud.spacetimedb.net`) and `SPACETIME_DB_NAME` with your Maincloud database name (e.g., `your-identity/your-database-name`).

## üåç World Configuration (Tile Size & Map Dimensions)

Changing the tile size, chunk configuration, or overall world dimensions requires coordinated modifications in **both** the client and server code to ensure consistency between rendering, collision detection, game logic, and world generation.

### Core Configuration Values

#### 1. **Client Configuration (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`):**

**Tile & World Size:**
*   `TILE_SIZE`: Visual pixel size of each grid tile (e.g., `48`). Must match server's `TILE_SIZE_PX`.
*   `SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`: Assumed width of the server's world in tiles (e.g., `500`). Must match server's `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`.
*   `SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES`: Assumed height of the server's world in tiles (e.g., `500`). Must match server's `WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES`.

**Chunk Configuration:**
*   `CHUNK_SIZE_TILES`: Number of tiles along one edge of a square chunk (e.g., `10`). Must match server's `CHUNK_SIZE_TILES`.

**Legacy/Compatibility Values:**
*   `worldWidth` and `worldHeight`: Should match `SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES` and `SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES`.
*   `spriteWidth` and `spriteHeight`: Player/entity sprite dimensions, typically match `TILE_SIZE`.

#### 2. **Server Configuration (`server/src/lib.rs`):**

**Primary Constants:**
*   `TILE_SIZE_PX`: Size of each tile in pixels (e.g., `pub const TILE_SIZE_PX: u32 = 48;`).
*   `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`: World width in tiles (e.g., `pub const WORLD_WIDTH_TILES: u32 = 500;`).
*   `WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES`: World height in tiles (e.g., `pub const WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES: u32 = 500;`).

**Derived Values (automatically calculated):**
*   `WORLD_WIDTH_PX`: World width in pixels (`(WORLD_WIDTH_TILES * TILE_SIZE_PX) as f32`).
*   `WORLD_HEIGHT_PX`: World height in pixels (`(WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES * TILE_SIZE_PX) as f32`).

#### 3. **Server Environment Configuration (`server/src/environment.rs`):**

**Chunk System:**
*   `CHUNK_SIZE_TILES`: Size of a chunk in tiles (e.g., `pub const CHUNK_SIZE_TILES: u32 = 10;`). Must match client.
*   `WORLD_WIDTH_CHUNKS`: Number of chunks across world width (auto-calculated).
*   `CHUNK_SIZE_PX`: Size of a chunk in pixels (auto-calculated).

#### 4. **World Generation Configuration (`server/src/world_generation.rs`):**

The `WorldGenConfig` struct controls procedural world generation:
*   `world_width_tiles`: Should match `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES` in `lib.rs`.
*   `world_height_tiles`: Should match `WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` in `lib.rs`.
*   `chunk_size`: Should match `CHUNK_SIZE_TILES` in `environment.rs`.
*   Other generation parameters: `seed`, `island_border_width`, `beach_width`, `river_frequency`, etc.

### Recommended Configuration Steps

**When changing world dimensions or tile size:**

1.  **Update Server Core (`server/src/lib.rs`):**
    ```rust
    pub const TILE_SIZE_PX: u32 = 48;        // Your desired tile size
    pub const WORLD_WIDTH_TILES: u32 = 500;   // Your desired world width
    pub const WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES: u32 = 500;  // Your desired world height
    ```

2.  **Update Server Environment (`server/src/environment.rs`):**
    ```rust
    pub const CHUNK_SIZE_TILES: u32 = 10;     // Your desired chunk size
    ```

3.  **Update World Generation Config (in `init_module` or world generation):**
    ```rust
    WorldGenConfig {
        world_width_tiles: 500,    // Match WORLD_WIDTH_TILES
        world_height_tiles: 500,   // Match WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES  
        chunk_size: 10,           // Match CHUNK_SIZE_TILES
        // ... other generation settings
    }
    ```

4.  **Update Client Config (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`):**
    ```typescript
    const TILE_SIZE = 48;                      // Match server TILE_SIZE_PX
    const SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES = 500;     // Match server WORLD_WIDTH_TILES
    const SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES = 500;    // Match server WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES
    const CHUNK_SIZE_TILES = 10;              // Match server CHUNK_SIZE_TILES
    ```

5.  **Rebuild and Republish:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    spacetime publish vibe-survival-game --clear-database  # Clear DB for schema changes
    spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .
    cd ..
    ```

**Important:** Ensure the `TILE_SIZE` (in `gameConfig.ts`) / `TILE_SIZE_PX` (in `lib.rs`) and the `SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`/`SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` (in `gameConfig.ts`) / `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`/`WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` (in `lib.rs`) values are kept consistent between the client and server configuration files. The `gameConfig.worldWidth` and `gameConfig.worldHeight` should also mirror these tile dimension values.

After making server-side changes, remember to **re-publish** the module:

```bash
# From the server/ directory
spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
# No need to regenerate client bindings for changing only these constants
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Local Setup

*   **`Cannot find module './generated'` error in client:**
    *   Ensure you ran `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .` from the `server` directory *after* the last `spacetime publish` was **successful**. Check the publish output for errors.
    *   Make sure the `client/src/generated` folder was actually created and contains `.ts` files, including `index.ts`.
    *   Restart the Vite dev server (`npm run dev`). Sometimes Vite needs a restart after significant file changes.
*   **Client connects but game doesn't load / players don't appear:**
    *   Check the browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors (e.g., subscription failures, rendering issues).
    *   Check the terminal running `spacetime start` for server-side Rust errors (e.g., reducer panics, assertion failures).
*   **Old players/data still appearing after disconnect/refresh:**
    *   Verify the `identity_disconnected` logic in `server/src/lib.rs` is correctly deleting the player, inventory, and equipment.
    *   For a guaranteed clean slate during development, delete and recreate the local database:
        ```bash
        # Stop spacetime start (Ctrl+C in its terminal)
        spacetime delete vibe-survival-game # Run from any directory
        spacetime start # Restart the server
        # Then re-publish and re-generate (Step 4 above)
        ```
*   **`spacetime publish` tries to publish to Maincloud instead of local:**
    *   Ensure you are logged out: `spacetime logout`.
    *   Ensure the `spacetime start` server is running *before* you publish.
    *   Check your SpacetimeDB config file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/SpacetimeDB/config/cli.toml` on Windows, `~/.local/share/spacetime/config/cli.toml` on Linux/macOS) and make sure `default_server` is set to `local` or commented out.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1.  **Server Development (`server/src`)**:
    *   Modify Rust code (add features, fix bugs).
    *   **Deploy changes using scripts:**
        ```bash
        cd server/
        ./deploy-local.ps1           # Quick local update
        ./deploy-local-clean.ps1     # Fresh local database (for schema changes)
        ```
2.  **Client Development (`client/src`)**:
    *   Modify React/TypeScript code.
    *   The Vite dev server (`npm run dev`) provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast updates.

## üöÄ Deployment Scripts

The project includes PowerShell scripts in the `server/` directory for streamlined deployment:

### Local Development Scripts
- **`deploy-local.ps1`** - Updates existing local database
  - Publishes to `broth-bullets-local`
  - Regenerates client bindings
  - Preserves existing data

- **`deploy-local-clean.ps1`** - Fresh local database deployment
  - Deletes existing `broth-bullets-local` database
  - Creates fresh database with latest schema
  - Regenerates client bindings
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è Wipes all data** - use for schema changes

### Production Scripts
- **`deploy-production.ps1`** - Updates production database
  - Publishes to `broth-bullets` on maincloud
  - Regenerates client bindings
  - **Commits from root directory** to capture all changes (server + client)
  - Pushes to trigger Vercel deployment
  - Preserves existing data

- **`deploy-production-clean.ps1`** - Fresh production deployment
  - Deletes existing `broth-bullets` database on maincloud
  - Creates fresh database with latest schema
  - Regenerates client bindings
  - **Commits from root directory** to capture all changes (server + client)
  - Pushes to trigger Vercel deployment
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è Wipes all production data** - use carefully

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Local development - quick update
cd server/
./deploy-local.ps1

# Local development - schema changes
cd server/
./deploy-local-clean.ps1

# Production deployment - safe update
cd server/
./deploy-production.ps1

# Production deployment - major schema changes
cd server/
./deploy-production-clean.ps1  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution!
```

**üìù Important Note:** Production scripts automatically navigate to the root directory before committing to ensure all changes (both server and client bindings) are captured in the git commit. This ensures Vercel deployments include the latest generated client bindings.

## üé® Art Generation Prompts

This section contains the prompts used for generating game assets with AI tools like GPT-4o.

### Item Icons

For generating game item icons (weapons, tools, consumables, etc.):

```
A pixel art style SUBJECT (i.e., hammer) with consistent pixel width and clean black outlines, designed as a game item icon. Rendered with a transparent background, PNG format. The object should have a clear silhouette, sharp pixel-level detail, and fit naturally in a top-down RPG game like Secret of Mana. No background, no shadows outside the object. Stylized with a warm palette and light dithering where appropriate.
```

**Usage**: Replace "SUBJECT" with the specific item (e.g., "hammer", "health potion", "wooden sword")

### Environment Assets / Doodads

For generating environment objects, structures, and decorative elements:

```
Pixel art sprite in a 16-bit RPG style, 3/4 top-down view (slightly angled perspective), clean outlines, vibrant color palette, soft shading with no directional highlights (shading handled via in-game shaders), set on a transparent background. Focus on a blocky, detailed silhouette with depth visible in the form. Centered and properly grounded in the scene.

Subject: SUBJECT, i.e. Oak Tree
```

**Usage**: Replace "SUBJECT" with the specific environment object (e.g., "Oak Tree", "Stone Boulder", "Wooden Campfire", "Small Bush")

### Spritesheets

For generating character animations and complex sprite sequences, use **[retrodiffusion.ai](https://retrodiffusion.ai)** to generate spritesheets.

This specialized tool is designed specifically for creating pixel art spritesheets with consistent character designs across multiple frames, making it ideal for:
- Character walking animations
- Idle animations
- Object state variations
- Multi-directional sprites

The tool maintains consistency between frames and generates properly formatted spritesheets that can be directly imported into game engines.
